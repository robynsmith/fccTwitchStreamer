- (1) As a user, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

- (2) As a user, I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

- (3) As a user, if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

- (5) Use an array of streamers for testing purposes. The status of each of these users should be displayed. This is the array to be used:

users = ["freecodecamp", "storbeck", "terakilobyte", "habathcx","RobotCaleb","thomasballinger","noobs2ninjas","beohoff"];

- (4) As a user,  I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). (Hint: You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers).
